// This file is the cmd/den package-local named-proof FLOOR. testing.M.Run()
// returns only an exit code, never which tests ran, so a build that silently
// skips/excludes the four hermetic platform_override proofs (build-tag drift,
// a stray `t.Skip`, a deleted test that still leaves the rest of cmd/den
// green) would exit 0. TestMain asserts, by NAME, that each required proof
// executed.
//
// This is a TRUE NAMED-SET floor, NOT the netpolicytest count model. A
// reviewer correctly flagged that netpolicytest.Mark only increments an
// int64 and never records t.Name(): a bare counter would still pass if any
// OTHER cmd/den test ran after a proof was deleted — that is a count floor
// mislabeled "named". Here mark(t) records t.Name() into `seen` and TestMain
// asserts the SPECIFIC required names are present, so deleting any one fails
// loudly even with the rest of cmd/den green.
//
// runFilterActive() is intentionally a ~6-line copy of
// netpolicytest/mark.go's unexported helper (cross-referenced here). The
// floor is inert under an explicit -run/-skip because the operator then
// deliberately selected a subset (e.g. `make test-integration` runs
// `-run TestIntegration`, matching zero cmd/den proofs) — enforcing it there
// would be a false failure. A tiny independent name-set is lower-risk than
// widening netpolicytest's API or coupling two unrelated package floors by
// reading its shared counter (different package, different suite).

// requiredProofs are the four hermetic platform_override proofs that MUST
// have executed on an unfiltered `go test ./cmd/den/...`.
